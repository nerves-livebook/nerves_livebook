# Configure WiFi

```elixir
Mix.install([
  {:vintage_net_wifi, "~> 0.11"},
  {:kino, "~> 0.12"}
])
```

## Finding access points

Nerves uses [vintage_net_wifi](https://hexdocs.pm/vintage_net_wifi/) to
configure WiFi networking. This notebook uses the `quick_` functions to
simplify common tasks. If you're trying to connect to an enterprise network,
this may not work for you.

Step 1 is to see what WiFi networks are available.
`VintageNetWiFi.quick_scan/0` returns a lot of information, so lets just show a
few columns in a table. Rerun this if you don't see your network.

```elixir
networks = VintageNetWiFi.quick_scan()

networks
|> Kino.DataTable.new(
  name: "WiFi Networks",
  keys: [:ssid, :signal_percent, :frequency, :flags],
  sorting_enabled: false
)
```

#### WPA3 support

A WiFi network that uses WPA3 shows up with `:sae` in the flags. Support for
WPA3 networks depends on hardware and device driver support. Raspberry Pi 4 and
5 support WPA3.

## Connect

Next, lets connect to one of the WiFi networks. Select the SSID and enter the
password.

```elixir
selectable_networks =
  [{"", "SSIDs:"}] ++ Enum.map(networks, fn network -> {network.ssid, network.ssid} end)

selected_network =
  Kino.Input.select("Select WiFi Network", selectable_networks)
  |> Kino.render()

psk_input = Kino.Input.password("Enter WiFi password")
```

Verify that the information is correct and then evaluate the following code block to set it.

```elixir
ssid = Kino.Input.read(selected_network) |> String.trim()
psk = Kino.Input.read(psk_input) |> String.trim()

if ssid != "" do
  VintageNetWiFi.quick_configure(ssid, psk)
else
  IO.puts("Skipping WiFi configuration.")
end
```

## Check the connection

The final step is to check whether everything worked. `VintageNet.info/0` is an
easy way of checking overall network connectivity on a device, so run it.
Hopefully, you'll see a section for `"wlan0"` and a connection status of
`:internet`. You may need to scroll down.

```elixir
VintageNet.info()
```
